Title:
Active Learning for NLP in predicting the relevance and sentiment of tweets about politics of China

Abstract:
The US-China relationship is changing rapidly. To better understand its dynamics, monitoring and analyzing Twitter data posted by members of Congress becomes important. Before analyzing the tweets, there is a need to distinguish the sentimental posts from the factual posts and provide them with labels of different sentiment levels. Currently, there have been two classifiers trained using the text features from the tweets to predict the relevance and sentiment of the tweets. The goal of this project is to explore the possibility of employing an active learning pipeline to automate the labeling procedure with these two classification models while enhancing the prediction accuracy over time with new coming tweets. After investigating the effectiveness of Active Learning, we found that Posterior probability-based sampling strategy is more effective in identifying informative data for model updating. Moreover, our study found that unbalanced data leads to consistent improvements in metric differences, but this also results in a bias toward the oversized category. Sorting data by time has a minor impact on accuracy but leads to higher recall. The partition ratio among the training, unlabeled, and test sets suggests that the optimal model is the one with the most training and unlabeled data. Additionally, increasing the sampling size leads to improvements in most metrics. The most accurate models is a Random Forest Classifier with an 80% accuracy for relevance prediction and a Ridge Logistic Regression with accuracies of approximately 75%, 44%, and 67% for negative, neutral, and positive sentiment labels, respectively.
